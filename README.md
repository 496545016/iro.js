### Intro

Iro is a new Javascript color picker library, it boasts a sleek UI with a whole host of features, all in a tidy ~9KB package.

### Features

* Fancy color wheel UI with touch support
* Based on the HSV color model, with color conversion between RGB, HSV, HSL and hexadecimal RGB
* Attach your own hook function to listen for changes to the color value
* Override CSS rules with the picker's color value
* Zero dependencies -- not even jQuery!
* Lightweight, at just over 9KB minified (or 3KB minified + gzipped)

### Todo

**before first full release:**
* Improve color string parsing
* Finalize API
* Write documentation

**later:**
* Add alpha / transparency support
* Add support for high-pixel-density displays
* Add high dynamic range (values higher than 100 / lower than 0) support
* Add more color models, like CMYK?
