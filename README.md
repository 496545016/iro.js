## iro.js

Iro is a Javascript color picker library, based on the HSV color model.

Please note that it's currently in beta. (:

### Features

* Fancy color wheel UI
* Color conversion between RGB, HSV, HSL and hexadecimal RGB
* Attach your own hook function to listen for changes to the color value
* Override CSS rules with the picker's color value
* Zero dependencies -- not even jQuery!
* Lightweight, at 9KB minified (or ~3KB minified + gzipped)

### Todo

**before first full release:**
* Improve color string parsing
* Finalise API
* Write documentation

**later:**
* Add alpha / transparency support
* Add touch event support
* Add support for high-pixel-density displays
* Add high dynamic range (values higher than 100 / lower than 0) support
* Add more color models, like CMYK?
